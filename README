cDCL is an experimental distribution of the DCL and K libraries. It is
based on the automake and autoconf tools. Currently, not all
functionality provided by the DCL and K libraries is supported, if the
full functionality is needed, the original DCL and K distributions are
recommended.

The library has to be compiled in 32 bit mode for now, as it contains hardcoded
dependencies between pointer sizes and integers. To do so, run configure as
follows:

./configure CXX="gcc -m32"

K README
========

K (K libs) is a set of multi-platform C++ classes to handle various
stuff including:
- unicode conversion
- genetic programming
- multi-platform routines
- 64 bits arithmetics
- DES encryption with NewtonOS variant.

It was successfully compiled on Unix (MacOS X, FreeBSD, Linux) and
Windows (with cygwin). Some classes are also used in some programs for
NewtonOS.

K is released under the Mozilla Public License. Most of it was written
by Paul Guyot (pguyot@kallisys.net) and a class was also authored by
Michael Vacik and Nicolas Zinovieff.
